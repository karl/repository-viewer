# Repository Viewer

A very simple GitHub repository Viewer

## Getting Started

### Install Node.js

You will need `node.js` and `npm`.
If you don't already have them you can install them from https://nodejs.org/en/

### Install prerequisites

```
npm install
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

If you want to tinker with the code `npm run build-dev` will build
the code with source maps and automatically watch for changes.

### Run Dev Server

```
npm run start
```

This will start a simple http server on port `8080`.

### View

Open http://localhost:8080/
